# Chef Community Cookbook Documentation

Pertinent documentation for all [cookbooks managed by Chef Software, Inc](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks). Cookbooks in [this GitHub organization](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks) are generally referred to as "Chef-managed community cookbooks".

## Why not stick the documentation in each repo?

Any documentation in this repository applies to all Chef-managed community cookbooks. With the same files in multiple repos, significant time was spent syncing the files, and they quickly became out of sync. Additionally if the documentation for an older revision of a cookbook was read, that documentation would be out of date. A central repository allows for easy updates and always up-to-date docs.

## Why not stick the documentation on the docs site?

Our goal is for these documents to become living documents. Github allows for easy browsing as well as simple edits from the community with the fork / pull request model.

## Tools Repo

We also maintain a repo that documents the tooling we use as a team at <https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/community_cookbook_tools>
