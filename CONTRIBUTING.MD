# Contributing to Chef Software Cookbooks

We're glad you want to contribute to Chef-managed community cookbooks! The first
step is the desire to improve the project.

## Quick Contributing Steps

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com).
2. Create an account on the [Chef Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/).
3. [Become a contributor](https://supermarket.chef.io/become-a-contributor) by
signing our Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
4. Create a pull request for your change on [GitHub](https://github.com).
5. The community cookbook maintainers will review your change, and either merge
the change or offer suggestions.


## The Apache License and the CLA/CCLA
Licensing is very important to open source projects. It helps ensure the
software continues to be available under the terms that the author desired.

Chef uses [the Apache 2.0 license]( https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
to strike a balance between open contribution and allowing you to use the
software however you would like to.

The license tells you what rights you have that are provided by the copyright
holder. It is important that the contributor fully understands what rights they
are licensing and agrees to them. Sometimes the copyright holder isn't the
contributor, such as when the contributor is doing work for a company.

To make a good faith effort to ensure these criteria are met, Chef requires an
Individual CLA or a Corporate CLA for contributions. This agreement helps ensure
you are aware of the terms of the license you are contributing your copyrighted
works under, which helps to prevent the inclusion of works in the projects that
the contributor does not hold the rights to share.

It only takes a few minutes to complete a CLA, and you retain the copyright to
your contribution.

You can complete our [Individual
CLA](https://supermarket.chef.io/icla-signatures/new) online. If you're
contributing on behalf of your employer and they retain the copyright for your
works, have your employer fill out our [Corporate
CLA](https://supermarket.chef.io/ccla-signatures/new) instead.

### Chef Obvious Fix Policy

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small
enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a
contributor as a patch, without a CLA.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new
functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect
functionality. Some likely examples include the following:

* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

**Whenever you invoke the “obvious fix” rule, please say so in your commit
message:**

```

  Fix typo in the README.

  Obvious fix.

## <a name="issues"></a>Issue Tracking

Chef uses Github Issues to track issues with the community cookbooks. Issues
should be submitted in the appropriate cookbook's Github repository at:
https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/COOKBOOK_NAME/issues/new.

In order to decrease the back and forth in issues, and to help us get to the
bottom of them quickly we use the below issue template. You can copy/paste this
template into the issue you are opening and edit it accordingly.

<a name="issuetemplate"></a>
```
### Environment: [Details about the environment such as the Operating System,
cookbook details, etc...]

### Scenario:
[What you are trying to achieve and you can't?]


### Steps to Reproduce:
[If you are filing an issue what are the things we need to do in order to repro your problem?]


### Expected Result:
[What are you expecting to happen as the consequence of above reproduction steps?]


### Actual Result:
[What actually happens after the reproduction steps?]
```

## Using git

You can copy a chef cookbook repository to your local workstation by running
`git clone git://github.com/chef-cookbooks/COOKBOOKNAME.git`.

For collaboration purposes, it is best if you create a GitHub account
and fork the repository to your own account. Once you do this you will
be able to push your changes to your GitHub repository for others to
see and use.

If you have another repository in your GitHub account named the same
as the cookbook, we suggest you suffix the repository with `-cookbook`.

### Branches and Commits

You should submit your patch as a git branch named after the Github
issue, such as GH-22. This is called a _topic branch_ and allows users
to associate a branch of code with the ticket.

It is a best practice to have your commit message have a _summary
line_ that includes the ticket number, followed by an empty line and
then a brief description of the commit. This also helps other
contributors understand the purpose of changes to the code.

```text
    [GH-22] - platform_family and style

    * use platform_family for platform checking
    * update notifies syntax to "resource_type[resource_name]" instead of
      resources() lookup
    * GH-692 - delete config files dropped off by packages in conf.d
    * dropped debian 4 support because all other platforms have the same
      values, and it is older than "old stable" debian release
```

Remember that not all users use Chef in the same way or on the same
operating systems as you, so it is helpful to be clear about your use
case and change so they can understand it even when it doesn't apply
to them.

### More information

Additional help with git is available on the [Community
Contributions](https://docs.chef.io/community_contributions.html#use-git)
page on the Chef Docs site.

## Functional and Unit Tests

Chef cookbooks are tested with functional and unit tests to ensure
changes don't cause regressions for other use cases.  Ideally all
changes include either functional or unit tests.  See the TESTING.md
file for additional information on testing in chef cookbooks.

## Code Review

Chef Software regularly reviews code contributions and provides suggestions
for improvement in the code itself or the implementation.

## Release Cycle

The versioning for Chef Software Cookbook projects is X.Y.Z.

* X is a major release, which may not be fully compatible with prior major
releases
* Y is a minor release, which adds both new features and bug fixes
* Z is a patch release, which adds just bug fixes

Releases of Chef's cookbooks are usually announced on the Chef user
mailing list.

See the [Cookbook Versioning Policy]( https://chef-community.github.io/cvp/) for
more guidance on semantic versioning of cookbooks.

## Contribution Do's and Don't's

Please do include tests for your contribution. If you need help, ask
on the
[chef-dev mailing list](https://discourse.chef.io/c/dev)
or the
[#chef-hacking IRC channel]( https://community.chef.io/chat/chef-hacking).
Not all platforms that a cookbook supports may be supported by Test
Kitchen. Please provide evidence of testing your contribution if it
isn't trivial so we don't have to duplicate effort in testing.

Please do indicate new platform (families) or platform versions in the
commit message, and update the relevant ticket.

If a contribution adds new platforms or platform versions, indicate
such in the body of the commit message(s), and update the relevant
issues. When writing commit messages, it is helpful for others if
you indicate the issue. For example:
   git commit -m '[ISSUE-1041] - Updated pool resource to correctly delete.'

Please do ensure that your changes do not break or modify behavior for
other platforms supported by the cookbook. For example if your changes
are for Debian, make sure that they do not break on CentOS.

Please do **not** modify the version number in the `metadata.rb`, Chef
will select the appropriate version based on the release cycle
information above.

Please do **not** update the `CHANGELOG.md` for a new version. Not all
changes to a cookbook may be merged and released in the same versions.
Chef Software will update the `CHANGELOG.md` when releasing a new version of
the cookbook.
